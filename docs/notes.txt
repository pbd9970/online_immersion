chatroom.js will declare module chatroom
  * change name to online immersion?
app.routes will call page_ctrl
app.page_ctrl will be assigned to global variable
all other ctrls will be called from within directives that inherit from
app.page_ctrl. This will allow some directives to call transclude to operate in
the page_ctrl's scope. It will also mean that all controllers will have the 
page_ctrl as a parent.
